# [Lorentz Transformation of the Electric and Magnetic Fields, Visualized](https://em-transforms.vercel.app/)

This little web app demonstrates how the electric and magnetic fields [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electromagnetism_and_special_relativity#The_E_and_B_fields) under a [Lorentz boost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_transformation#Physical_formulation_of_Lorentz_boosts). It can also display the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector) and some dynamical quantities associated with a charged particle co-located with the field-vectors.

I made this with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)/[React](https://reactjs.org/), [zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [three.js](https://threejs.org/)/[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber). It's hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
